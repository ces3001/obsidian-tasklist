| 0.9.7   | 2023-04-21 | Added the tweak to avoid tasks that match some non-tag alias, if they contain a different tag.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 0.9.6   | 2023-04-01 | Bug fix: made sure tag and string matching is non-case-sensitive.
